# Tenkit 天気ト

A wrapper for Apple's WeatherKit API in Ruby

A portmanteau of "tenki" the Japanese word for weather, and "kit", the end of WeatherKit.

This project is in beta, some of its API may be unstable, or possibly non-functional (like WeatherKit itself). We recommend pinning the version in your Gemfile until we get to a stable release, at which point we will be using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Installation

Add to `Gemfile`

```
gem 'tenkit'
```

See Apple's instructions on how to [Get Started with Weatherkit](https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/get-started/). Your WeatherKit API dashboard should be at this URL <https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/services/weatherkit>.



## Usage

```ruby
Tenkit.configure do |c|
  c.team_id = "APPLE DEVELOPER TEAM ID"
  c.service_id = "APPLE DEVELOPER SERVICE ID"
  c.key_id = "APPLE DEVELOPER KEY ID"
  c.key =  "APPLE DEVELOPER PRIVATE KEY"
end

client = Tenkit::Client.new

lat = '37.323'
lon = '122.032'

client.weather(lat, lon)
```
